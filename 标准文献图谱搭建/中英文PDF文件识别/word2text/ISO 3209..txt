Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee.International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO,also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives,Part 3.
Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.
International Standard ISO 3209 was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC 20, Aircraft and space vehicles,Subcommittee SC 4,Aerospace fastener systems.
This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO 3209:1989), which has been technically revised.

Aerospace - Nuts, anchor, self-locking, floating, two lug, with
counterbore, with MJ threads, classifications: 1 100 MPa (at
ambient temperature)/235 °C, 1 100 MPa (at ambient

1 Scope
This International Standard specifies the dimensions of self-locking, floating, two lug anchor nuts,with counterbore, with MJ threads,of classifications:1 100 MPa 1/235 °C 2), 1 100 MPa 1/315 °C 2) and 1 100 MPa 1)/425 °C 2).
This International Standard is only applicable for the compilation of aerospace product standards.
2 Normative references
The following normative documents contain provisions which,through reference in this text, constitute provisions of this International Standard. For dated references,subsequent amendments to, or revisions of, any of these publications do not apply. However, parties to agreements based on this International Standard are encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying the most recent editions of the normative documents indicated below.For undated references,the latest edition of the normative document referred to applies. Members of ISO and IEC maintain registers of currently valid International Standards.
ISO 5855-2:1988,Aerospace-MJ threads-Part 2:Limit dimensions for bolts and nuts.
ISO 5858:1991,Aerospace-Self-locking nuts with maximum operating temperature less than or equal to 425℃-Procurement specification.
ISO 8788:1987,Aerospace-Fasteners-Tolerances of form and position for nuts.
3 Configuration and dimensions
See Figure 1 and Table 1. Dimensions and tolerances are expressed in millimetres. They apply after any surface coating(s) but before the application of any lubricant.
The metallic cap (optional) shall remain joined to the nut at the maximum operating temperature (type of attachment at the user's discretion). See ISO 5858 for the test conditions.
1) Corresponds to the minimum tensile stress which the nut is able to withstand at ambient temperature without breaking or cracking when tested with a bolt of a higher strength class.
2) Maximum temperature that the nut is able to withstand, without permanent alteration to its original characteristics, after ambient temperature has been restored.The maximum temperature is conditioned by the surface treatment.
